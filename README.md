# 📚 AI-Powered Knowledge Base (RAG + AWS + .NET + Angular)

> ⚠️ This project is in its **early development phase**. I’m building it step by step as a portfolio project to showcase **Cloud + AI + Full-Stack** skills.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Companies often have tons of unstructured documents — PDFs, manuals, policies, and reports — making it hard for employees to find the right information quickly.  

This project aims to solve that using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered by **AWS + Bedrock + OpenSearch**. Users will be able to **upload documents** and then **chat with them** through a simple chatbot interface.

---

## 🎯 Key Features (Planned)
- 📤 Upload documents (PDF, Word, etc.) → stored in **AWS S3**  
- 🔎 Automatic text extraction + chunking  
- 🧠 Create embeddings using **AWS Bedrock**  
- 📂 Store embeddings in **OpenSearch** for semantic search  
- 💬 Chat interface (Angular/Flutter) to ask questions about the documents  
- ☁️ Backend powered by **.NET Core Web API + AWS Lambda/API Gateway**  
- 🔐 (Future) Authentication & access control with **AWS Cognito**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular (chat UI) / Flutter (optional mobile app)  
- **Backend:** .NET Core Web API, AWS Lambda  
- **Cloud & AI:**  
  - AWS S3 (document storage)  
  - AWS Bedrock (LLM + embeddings)  
  - AWS OpenSearch (vector DB)  
  - AWS API Gateway, Lambda  
- **Other Tools:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), CloudWatch (monitoring)
